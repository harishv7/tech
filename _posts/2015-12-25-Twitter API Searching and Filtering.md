Just recently, Chennai was tormented by floods due to heavy rainfall which placed a huge stress on the drainage systems and water storage. During this period of calamity, there were many people tweeting, either asking for help or offering help.

My intention was to create a portal or app that can match these help requests with the **correct** help offers. However, I was unable to complete this due to other reasons. 

Nevertheless, I tried to create a hashtag post aggregation first through the use of the Twitter API with the following ruby script:

{% gist harishv7/aabea902145482e3044c %}

If possible, I would try to make an interesting app out of hashtags filtering in my free time.
